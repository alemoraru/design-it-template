# DesignIT template

This repository contains a website template that was adapted to fit an interior design website. 
This was inspired from an already existing template, but was modified severely to fit the 
current web design standards.

This template includes: 
* Extensive use of selectors
* Use of html tags, limited to mostly html5
* Only __html__ and __css__, therefore no backend code included

## How can I view this website template?

Simply use clone the repository and open the index.html file

__Note__: Make sure to have all files under the same root folder as the html
require the css files in order for the website to be readable.

## Can I use this template?

Of course! Do not forget to star and share your creations as well!
Any suggestions will be taken into account and maybe included in the project itself.
