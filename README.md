# DesignIT template

This repository contains an __html__ and __css__ free custom made
template that was adapted for an interior design website. 
This was inspired from an already existing template, but was modified severely to fit the 
current web design standards.

This template includes: 
* Extensive use of selectors
* Use of html tags, limited to mostly html5
* Only __html__ and __css__, therefore no backend code included

## How can I view this website template?

Simply use clone the repository and open [design-it-template/index.html](index.html) to explore!

__Note__: Make sure to have all files under the same root folder as the html
require the css files in order for the website to be readable.

## Can I use this template?

Of course! Do not forget to star and share your creations as well!
Any suggestions will be taken into account and maybe included in the project itself.

__Note__: Both the html and css files use a fair share of romanian words, mainly because
the website was written as part of a course taught in that language, however the code
should still be readable regardless.
